# ML-Based-Surveillance-using-drones

As security concerns are increasing in the world, it is of utmost importance that the
surveillance is done in an efficient way. In this project, we have developed an end-to-end
system for such surveillance from a drone using Machine Learning Technologies. We have
used various detection and recognition models and compared their performance in order
to find the best suitable model for the given use case. As the real world conditions may
vary a lot depending on the lighting conditions in which the drone is flying or the quality of
the video feed from the drone, it is of utmost importance that our system is robust and can
tackle all these situations well. Thus, we have employed various data augmentation and
fine tuning techniques in order to make our model robust so that it can perform well in all
situations.

# Steps to Run the Repository:

1. Clone the Repository
2. Create a photos folder which contains the photos of each individual in the database in seperate folders
3. Install all the dependencies that are required
4. Run python webstreaming_master.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
